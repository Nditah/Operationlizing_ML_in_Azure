# Operationalizing The Machine Learning Model In Azure

The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model using Azure Container Services.We are provided with the banking dataset. The main steps to be followed to perform project are as follows :-

1) Authentication
2) Automated ML Experiment
3) Deploy the best model
4) Enable logging
5) Swagger Documentation
6) Consume model endpoints
7) Create and publish a pipeline
9) Documentation

 :pushpin: **Authentication**:- Authentication is crucial for the continuous flow of operations, continuous Integration and delivery system(CI/CD) rely on uninterrupted flows. If authentication is not set properly it requires human interactions and thus the flow is interrupted. Thus, its good to use authentication with automation because in ideal scenario the system doesn't stop waiting for a user to input a password.

Authentication types :-
 1) Key based
 2) Token based
 3) Interactive
