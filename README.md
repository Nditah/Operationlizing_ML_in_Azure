# Operationalizing The Machine Learning Model In Azure

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model using Azure Container Services.We are provided with the banking dataset. The main steps to be followed to perform project are as follows:-

1) Authentication
2) Automated ML Experiment
3) Deploy the best model
4) Enable logging

_TODO_: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model".
